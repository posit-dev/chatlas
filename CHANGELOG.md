## [UNRELEASED]

### Improvements

* `Chat.get_cost()` now covers many more models and also takes cached tokens into account. (#133)

## [0.9.1] - 2025-07-09

### Bug fixes

* Fixed an issue where `.chat()` wasn't streaming output properly in (the latest build of) Positron's Jupyter notebook. (#131)

* Needless warnings and errors are no longer thrown when model pricing info is unavailable. (#132)

## [0.9.0] - 2025-07-02

### New features

* `Chat` gains a handful of new methods: 
    * `.register_mcp_tools_http_stream_async()` and `.register_mcp_tools_stdio_async()`: for registering tools from a [MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). (#39)
    * `.get_tools()` and `.set_tools()`: for fine-grained control over registered tools. (#39)
    * `.set_model_params()`: for setting common LLM parameters in a model-agnostic fashion. (#127)
    * `.get_cost()`: to get the estimated cost of the chat. Only popular models are supported, but you can also supply your own token prices. (#106)
    * `.add_turn()`: to add `Turn`(s) to the current chat history. (#126)
* Tool functions passed to `.register_tool()` can now `yield` numerous results. (#39)
* A `ContentToolResultImage` content class was added for returning images from tools. It is currently only works with `ChatAnthropic`. (#39)
* A `Tool` can now be constructed from a pre-existing tool schema (via a new `__init__` method). (#39)
* The `Chat.app()` method gains a `host` parameter. (#122) 
* `ChatGithub()` now supports the more standard `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable for storing the API key. (#123)

### Changes

#### Breaking Changes

* `Chat` constructors (`ChatOpenAI()`, `ChatAnthropic()`, etc) no longer have a `turns` keyword parameter. Use the `.set_turns()` method instead to set the (initial) chat history. (#126)
* `Chat`'s `.tokens()` methods have been removed in favor of `.get_tokens()` which returns both cumulative tokens in the turn and discrete tokens. (#106)

#### Other Changes

* `Tool`'s constructor no longer takes a function as input. Use the new `.from_func()` method instead to create a `Tool` from a function. (#39)
* `.register_tool()` now throws an exception when the tool has the same name as an already registered tool. Set the new `force` parameter to `True` to force the registration. (#39)

### Improvements

* `ChatGoogle()` and `ChatVertex()` now default to Gemini 2.5 (instead of 2.0). (#125)
* `ChatOpenAI()` and `ChatGithub()` now default to GPT 4.1 (instead of 4o). (#115)
* `ChatAnthropic()` now supports `content_image_url()`. (#112)
* HTML styling improvements for `ContentToolResult` and `ContentToolRequest`. (#39)
* `Chat`'s representation now includes cost information if it can be calculated. (#106)
* `token_usage()` includes cost if it can be calculated. (#106)

### Bug fixes

* Fixed an issue where `httpx` client customization (e.g., `ChatOpenAI(kwargs = {"http_client": httpx.Client()})`) wasn't working as expected (#108)

### Developer APIs

* The base `Provider` class now includes a `name` and `model` property. In order for them to work properly, provider implementations should pass a `name` and `model` along to the `__init__()` method. (#106)
* `Provider` implementations must implement two new abstract methods: `translate_model_params()` and `supported_model_params()`.

## [0.8.1] - 2025-05-30

* Fixed `@overload` definitions for `.stream()` and `.stream_async()`.

## [0.8.0] - 2025-05-30

### New features

* New `.on_tool_request()` and `.on_tool_result()` methods register callbacks that fire when a tool is requested or produces a result. These callbacks can be used to implement custom logging or other actions when tools are called, without modifying the tool function (#101).
* New `ToolRejectError` exception can be thrown from tool request/result callbacks or from within a tool function itself to prevent the tool from executing. Moreover, this exception will provide some context for the the LLM to know that the tool didn't produce a result because it was rejected. (#101)

### Improvements

* The `CHATLAS_LOG` environment variable now enables logs for the relevant model provider. It now also supports a level of `debug` in addition to `info`. (#97)
* `ChatSnowflake()` now supports tool calling. (#98)
* `Chat` instances can now be deep copied, which is useful for forking the chat session. (#96)

### Changes

* `ChatDatabricks()`'s `model` now defaults to `databricks-claude-3-7-sonnet` instead of `databricks-dbrx-instruct`. (#95)
* `ChatSnowflake()`'s `model` now defaults to `claude-3-7-sonnet` instead of `llama3.1-70b`. (#98)

### Bug fixes

* Fixed an issue where `ChatDatabricks()` with an Anthropic `model` wasn't handling empty-string responses gracefully. (#95)


## [0.7.1] - 2025-05-10

* Added `openai` as a hard dependency, making installation easier for a wide range of use cases. (#91) 

## [0.7.0] - 2025-04-22

### New features

* Added `ChatDatabricks()`, for chatting with Databrick's [foundation models](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/machine-learning/model-serving/score-foundation-models). (#82)
* `.stream()` and `.stream_async()` gain a `content` argument. Set this to `"all"` to include `ContentToolResult`/`ContentToolRequest` objects in the stream. (#75)
* `ContentToolResult`/`ContentToolRequest` are now exported to `chatlas` namespace. (#75)
* `ContentToolResult`/`ContentToolRequest` gain a `.tagify()` method so they render sensibly in a Shiny app. (#75)
* A tool can now return a `ContentToolResult`. This is useful for: 
    * Specifying the format used for sending the tool result to the chat model (`model_format`). (#87)
    * Custom rendering of the tool result (by overriding relevant methods in a subclass). (#75)
* `Chat` gains a new `.current_display` property. When a `.chat()` or `.stream()` is currently active, this property returns an object with a `.echo()` method (to echo new content to the display). This is primarily useful for displaying custom content during a tool call. (#79)

### Improvements

* When a tool call ends in failure, a warning is now raised and the stacktrace is printed. (#79)
* Several improvements to `ChatSnowflake()`:
  * `.extract_data()` is now supported.
  *  `async` methods are now supported. (#81)
  * Fixed an issue with more than one session being active at once. (#83)
* `ChatAnthropic()` no longer chokes after receiving an output that consists only of whitespace. (#86)
* `orjson` is now used for JSON loading and dumping. (#87)

### Changes

* The `echo` argument of the `.chat()` method defaults to a new value of `"output"`. As a result, tool requests and results are now echoed by default. To revert to the previous behavior, set `echo="text"`. (#78)
* Tool results are now dumped to JSON by default before being sent to the model. To revert to the previous behavior, have the tool return a `ContentToolResult` with `model_format="str"`. (#87)

### Breaking changes

* The `.export()` method's `include` argument has been renamed to `content` (to match `.stream()`). (#75)

## [0.6.1] - 2025-04-03

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a missing dependency on the `requests` package.

## [0.6.0] - 2025-04-01

### New features

* New `content_pdf_file()` and `content_pdf_url()` allow you to upload PDFs to supported models. (#74)

### Improvements

* `Turn` and `Content` now inherit from `pydantic.BaseModel` to provide easier saving to and loading from JSON. (#72)

## [0.5.0] - 2025-03-18

### New features

* Added a `ChatSnowflake()` class to interact with [Snowflake Cortex LLM](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/llm-functions). (#54)
* Added a `ChatAuto()` class, allowing for configuration of chat providers and models via environment variables. (#38, thanks @mconflitti-pbc)

### Improvements

* Updated `ChatAnthropic()`'s `model` default to `"claude-3-7-sonnet-latest"`. (#62)
* The version is now accessible as `chatlas.__version__`. (#64)
* All provider-specific `Chat` subclasses now have an associated extras in chatlas. For example, `ChatOpenAI` has `chatlas[openai]`, `ChatPerplexity` has `chatlas[perplexity]`, `ChatBedrockAnthropic` has `chatlas[bedrock-anthropic]`, and so forth for the other `Chat` classes. (#66)

### Bug fixes

* Fixed an issue with content getting duplicated when it overflows in a `Live()` console. (#71)
* Fix an issue with tool calls not working with `ChatVertex()`. (#61)


## [0.4.0] - 2025-02-19

### New features

* Added a `ChatVertex()` class to interact with Google Cloud's Vertex AI. (#50)
* Added `.app(*, echo=)` support. This allows for chatlas to change the echo behavior when running the Shiny app. (#31)

### Improvements

* Migrated `ChatGoogle()`'s underlying python SDK from `google-generative` to `google-genai`. As a result, streaming tools are now working properly. (#50)

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a bug where synchronous chat tools would not work properly when used in a `_async()` context. (#56)
* Fix broken `Chat`'s Shiny app when `.app(*, stream=True)` by using async chat tools. (#31)
* Update formatting of exported markdown to use `repr()` instead of `str()` when exporting tool call results. (#30)

## [0.3.0] - 2024-12-20

### New features

* `Chat`'s `.tokens()` method gains a `values` argument. Set it to `"discrete"` to get a result that can be summed to determine the token cost of submitting the current turns. The default (`"cumulative"`), remains the same (the result can be summed to determine the overall token cost of the conversation).
* `Chat` gains a `.token_count()` method to help estimate token cost of new input. (#23)

### Bug fixes

* `ChatOllama` no longer fails when a `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is not set.
* `ChatOpenAI` now correctly includes the relevant `detail` on `ContentImageRemote()` input.
* `ChatGoogle` now correctly logs its `token_usage()`. (#23)
